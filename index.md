## <span style="color:steelblue">Research Interests</span>
Shixun is interested in problems that arise at the cross-intersection of databases, machine learning, and theoretical computer science, with the research mission of creating deployable solutions with theoretical guarantees, improving people's daily life and increasing economic growth. These problems include but are not limited to:

**Graph Data Analytics**. Problems that discover complex relationships between linked entities (e.g., graph representation learning, link prediction and clustering) or interesting structures/patterns in networks (e.g., motif counting and graph planarization).

**Viral Marketing**. Problems that drive better decision making in viral marketing campaigns (e.g., influencer selection, influencer pricing and friend recommendation for information diffusion).

**Urban Computing**. Problems that pertain to important applications for smart cities (e.g., route planning, server deployment in mobile edge computing, and traffic monitoring).

### Research Projects
* **Combinatorial Optimization in Graphs**.

    Many real-world problems (e.g., influencers selection for advertising and friend recommendation) in graphs (e.g., social networks, product networks and knowledge graphs) can be formulated as combinatorial problems. I am interested in solving them by proposing scalable and effective algorithms with different techniques such as randomization and sampling.
    
* **Machine Learning in Graphs**.

    I am interested in adopting and extending the state-of-the-arts machine learning techniques (e.g., convolution neural networks, sequence to sequence models and reinforcement learning) from other fields (e.g., natural language processing and computer vision) into graphs, such that many notoriously hard problems (e.g., link prediction, node and label classification and finding the shortest path) in graphs can be effectively solved and human can get inspirations from learning models to design new algorithms.

* **Community Dectection in Graphs**.

    Individual decisions are not made in isolation since people biasedly interact with and impose peer pressure on each other, which is largely caused by homophily and results in the formation of community. I am interested in mining insightful topological information (e.g., interaction patterns) and leveraging this information to detect community.
