Shixun is currently a reserach fellow at RMIT. He received his bachelor's degree of Software Engineering in 2015 from Nanjing University and received his master's degree of Information Technology in 2017 from the University of Melbourne. He received his PhD degree in June, 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhifeng Bao][zhifeng] and [Prof. J. Shane Culpepper][pepper]. He is interested in problems that arise at the cross-intersection of databases, machine learning, and theoretical computer science. His research focuses on data mining, combinatorial optimization problems and AI+DB (AI for DB and DB for AI).

### Research Projects
* **Combinatorial Optimization in Graphs**.

    Many real-world problems (e.g., influencers selection for advertising and friend recommendation) in graphs (e.g., social networks, product networks and knowledge graphs) can be formulated as combinatorial problems. I am interested in solving them by proposing scalable and effective algorithms with different techniques such as randomization and sampling.
    
* **Machine Learning in Graphs**.

    I am interested in adopting and extending the state-of-the-arts machine learning techniques (e.g., convolution neural networks, sequence to sequence models and reinforcement learning) from other fields (e.g., natural language processing and computer vision) into graphs, such that many notoriously hard problems (e.g., link prediction, node and label classification and finding the shortest path) in graphs can be effectively solved and human can get inspirations from learning models to design new algorithms.

* **Community Dectection in Graphs**.

    Individual decisions are not made in isolation since people biasedly interact with and impose peer pressure on each other, which is largely caused by homophily and results in the formation of community. I am interested in mining insightful topological information (e.g., interaction patterns) and leveraging this information to detect community.
